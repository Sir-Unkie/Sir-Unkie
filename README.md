I’m a Front-End (React) Developer. My passion is to develop functional and appealing web-based applications with a focus on great user experience, optimized performance and efficiency.

I create designs and quickly transform them into responsive web applications.
I love using the React framework to break down the application into the applicable components while integrating with Redux to manage state information.

I am eager to learn new technologies (now it is React Native) and improve my knowledge as I spend most of my free time improving my skills.
